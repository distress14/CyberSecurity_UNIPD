## Character Encoding - Challenge 115

Description:
```
In the computing industry, standards are established to facilitate information interchanges among American coders. Unfortunately, I've made communication a little bit more difficult. Can you figure this one out? 41 42 43 54 46 7B 34 35 43 31 31 5F 31 35 5F 55 35 33 46 55 4C 7D
```

It seams that we can use the Hexadecimal decoder to find the flag

I used: https://www.duplichecker.com/hex-to-text.php to convert:

From:
```
41 42 43 54 46 7B 34 35 43 31 31 5F 31 35 5F 55 35 33 46 55 4C 7D
```

To:
```
A B C T F { 4 5 C 1 1 _ 1 5 _ U 5 3 F U L }
```

If we delete the spaces created, we find the flag:
```
ABCTF{45C11_15_U53FUL}
```

## Base 2 2 the 6 - Challenge 192

Description:
```
There are so many different ways of encoding and decoding information nowadays... One of them will work! Q1RGe0ZsYWdneVdhZ2d5UmFnZ3l9
```

It seams that we can use the Base64 decoder to find the flag:

I used: https://www.base64decode.org to convert:

From:
```
Q1RGe0ZsYWdneVdhZ2d5UmFnZ3l9
```

To:
```

## Morse Code - Challenge 309

Description:
```
..-. .-.. .- --. ... .- -- ..- . .-.. -- --- .-. ... . .. ... -.-. --- --- .-.. -... -.-- - .... . .-- .- -.-- .. .-.. .. -.- . -.-. .... . . ...
```

This is pretty forward, we can use an online Morse decoder to find the flag: https://morsecode.world/international/translator.html

If we convert the description, we are rewarded with the flag:
```
FLAGSAMUELMORSEISCOOLBYTHEWAYILIKECHEES
```

## Reverse Polarity - Challenge 230

Description:
```
I got a new hard drive just to hold my flag, but I'm afraid that it rotted. What do I do? The only thing I could get off of it was this: 01000011010101000100011001111011010000100110100101110100010111110100011001101100011010010111000001110000011010010110111001111101
```

We can use an online Binary converter to find the flag: https://www.convertbinary.com/to-text/

If we convert:
```
01000011010101000100011001111011010000100110100101110100010111110100011001101100011010010111000001110000011010010110111001111101
```

We are rewarded with the flag:
```

## Hextraordinary 158

Description:
```
Meet ROXy, a coder obsessed with being exclusively the worlds best hacker. She specializes in short cryptic hard to decipher secret codes. The below hex values for example, she did something with them to generate a secret code, can you figure out what? Your answer should start with 0x.

0xc4115 0x4cf8
```

If we meet ROXy, we can thing that we can use some sort of XOR operation to find the flag. 

So, we can go to: https://xor.pw/# , where:
```
Input1 = 0xc4115
Input2 = 0x4cf8
```
Same as saying:
```
0xc4115 ^ 0x4cf8 = ??
```

The result will be:
```
0xc4115 ^ 0x4cf8 = c0ded
```

Like the description says "```Your answer should start with 0x```", so we add 0x before c0ded:
```
Flag = 0xc0ded
```

We have found the flag

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Vigenere Cipher - Challenge 305

Description:
```
The vignere cipher is a method of encrypting alphabetic text by using a series of interwoven Caesar ciphers based on the letters of a keyword.<br />

Iâ€™m not sure what this means, but it was left lying around: blorpy

gwox{RgqssihYspOntqpxs}
```

Like the title says, it seams that they used the vigenere cipher to encode the text.

So we try to decode it with an online vigenere decoder: https://www.dcode.fr/vigenere-cipher

Do not forget to add the KEY used to encode it: blorpy

As result, we are rewarded with the flag:
```
flag{CiphersAreAwesome}
```

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Substitution Cipher - Challenge 238

Description:
```
Someone gave me this, but I haven't the slightest idea as to what it says! https://mega.nz/#!iCBz2IIL!B7292dJSx1PGXoWhd9oFLk2g0NFqGApBaItI_2Gsp9w Figure it out for me, will ya?

If we follow the Mega link, we'll have some sort of encrypted text:

Like the title says, we can imagine that they used some sort of substitution cipher to encode it;

So, if we go to:  https://planetcalc.com/8047/, we can try to bruteforce it and decode it:

We can find the flag in the first line of the decrypted message:

## RSA Noob - Challenge 120

Description:
```
These numbers were scratched out on a prison wall. Can you help me decode them? https://mega.nz/#!al8iDSYB!s5olEDK5zZmYdx1LZU8s4CmYqnynvU_aOUvdQojJPJQ
```

If we follow the Mega link, we'll have some sort of information and letters:

```
e: 1
c:9327565722767258308650643213344542404592011161659991421
n: 245841236512478852752909734912575581815967630033049838269083
```

That's strange, but if we google these numbers, we discover that they are used for RSA encryption (like the title says)

From wikipedia:
```
RSAÂ (Rivestâ€“Shamirâ€“Adleman) is aÂ public-key cryptosystem, one of the oldest that is widely used for secure data transmission.

In a public-keyÂ cryptosystem, theÂ encryption keyÂ is public and distinct from theÂ decryption key, which is kept secret private. 
An RSA user creates and publishes a public key based on two largeÂ prime numbers, along with an auxiliary value. The prime numbers are kept secret. 

Messages can be encrypted by anyone, via the public key, but can only be decoded by someone who knows the prime numbers

There are no published methods to defeat the system if a large enough key is used.


RSA is a relatively slow algorithm. Because of this, it is not commonly used to directly encrypt user data. More often, RSA is used to transmit shared keys forÂ symmetric-keyÂ cryptography, which are then used for bulk encryptionâ€“decryption.

Decryption:
Alice can recoverÂ mÂ fromÂ cÂ by using her private key exponentÂ dÂ by computing

c^d â‰¡ (m^e)^d â‰¡ m (mod n)

GivenÂ m, she can recover the original messageÂ MÂ by reversing the padding scheme.
```

So, we have
```
e: 1.   #Public key
c:9327565722767258308650643213344542404592011161659991421     #Cipher-text
n: 245841236512478852752909734912575581815967630033049838269083        #Module
```
If we do the reverse operation, we find that:
```
m = 9327565722767258308650643213344542404592011161659991421     #Original message (Plain-Text)
```

After that, we need to convert m from Decimal to Hexadecimal.

We can use: https://www.rapidtables.com/convert/number/decimal-to-hex.html

It converts into this Hex-text
```
61626374667B6233747465725F75705F793075725F657D
```

Finally, we can decode it
We can use this site to do the conversion from Hexadecimal to ASCII: https://www.rapidtables.com/convert/number/hex-to-ascii.html

And we are rewarded with the flag:
```
abctf{b3tter_up_y0ur_e}
```
